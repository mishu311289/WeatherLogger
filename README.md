# WeatherLogger

Among non-functional requirements, couldn't finish unit tests yet because of time shortage considering the current project deadlines. 

Among optional requirements, following have been done:

● UI layout optimized for both Phone and Tablets screens
● Implement ‘More details’ option with some more info on same screen.
● Use Kotlin instead of Java for MainActivity
